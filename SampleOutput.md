## [150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation/)

> 
> Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in [Reverse Polish
Notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).
> Valid operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`. Each operand may be an integer or
another expression.
> Some examples:
> ["2", "1", "+", "3", "*"] -> ((2 + 1) * 3) -> 9
      ["4", "13", "5", "/", "+"] -> (4 + (13 / 5)) -> 6
